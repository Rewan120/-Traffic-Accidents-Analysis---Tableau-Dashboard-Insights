Traffic Accidents Analysis Project

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of traffic accidents using a structured dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights to improve road safety measures. The analysis is performed using Tableau, and the findings are presented through interactive dashboards and a structured report.

ðŸ“Š Dataset


Total Records: 660,679

Key Fields:

Accident Date

Location (Latitude & Longitude)

Severity

Road Type

Weather Conditions

ðŸ›  Data Cleaning & Preparation

The dataset underwent preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency:

Removed missing and duplicate records

Standardized date and categorical values

Handled outliers for improved accuracy

Filtered out incomplete location data

ðŸ“ˆ Key Visualizations

Accident Hotspots (Heatmap) â€“ Identifies high-risk accident locations.

Monthly Trends (Line Chart) â€“ Shows the fluctuation of accidents over time.

Weather Impact (Bar Chart) â€“ Analyzes how weather conditions influence accident frequency.

Road Type Analysis (Bar Chart) â€“ Displays which types of roads have the highest accident occurrences.
